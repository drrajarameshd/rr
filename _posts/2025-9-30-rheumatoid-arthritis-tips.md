**Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)** is a long-term autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and pain in the joints. But what many patients don’t realise is — **early treatment makes all the difference.**

## 🧬 What is Rheumatoid Arthritis?

- RA is not just “old age” or “wear and tear.”  
- It is an **autoimmune condition** — where the body’s own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy joint tissue.  
- This leads to **swelling, stiffness, joint damage**, and over time, **deformities** — especially if treatment is delayed.

**Commonly affected joints:**  
🔹 Fingers, wrists, elbows  
🔹 Knees, ankles, feet  
🔹 Often **symmetrical** (same joints on both sides)

## 💊 DMARDs: Disease-Modifying Drugs (and Why They Take Time)

Your doctor may prescribe **DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs)** like Methotrexate, Leflunomide, Sulfasalazine, or Hydroxychloroquine.

### Important points:
- **DMARDs work slowly** — they may take **4 to 12 weeks** before showing visible improvement.  
- They **don’t give quick pain relief** like painkillers or steroids — but they **prevent long-term joint damage**.  
- Some patients mistakenly **stop them early**, thinking they are not working — this is a **big mistake**.

👉 DMARDs are your **main defense** against joint damage in RA.

## ⚠️ Steroids: Use with Caution

Steroids like **prednisolone** may be used briefly to **control severe flare-ups**, especially in early disease or while waiting for DMARDs to take effect.

But long-term, unsupervised use of steroids can cause:

❌ Weight gain  
❌ High sugar and blood pressure  
❌ Bone thinning (osteoporosis)  
❌ Cataracts  
❌ Suppressed immunity  

> **Never use steroids long-term without your doctor’s supervision.**

## ❌ Don’t Stop DMARDs Abruptly

Some patients stop their medications when they “feel better.” But RA is a chronic condition — **symptom-free doesn’t mean disease-free**.

- **Stopping DMARDs suddenly** can lead to painful **flares**, and more joint damage.  
- Always consult your doctor before making any changes to your treatment plan.

## ✅ Practical Tips for RA Patients

- 🔹 **Be patient** — DMARDs take time to show effect.  
- 🔹 Use **painkillers or short steroid courses** only during flare-ups — as advised.  
- 🔹 **Stick to your medicine schedule** — don’t stop on your own.  
- 🔹 **Regular follow-ups** and blood tests are important.  
- 🔹 Do gentle **joint-friendly exercises** — ask your doctor for guidance.  
- 🔹 **Healthy diet**, **calcium and vitamin D**, and weight control help joint health.

## 👩‍⚕️ Final Advice

RA treatment is a long journey, but **well-controlled RA means better quality of life** and less joint damage. Early diagnosis and correct use of DMARDs can prevent disability.

> Trust your rheumatologist, follow your medicines, and avoid self-medication — especially with steroids.
