## What are Intervertebral Discs?
Your backbone (spine) is made of small bones called **vertebrae**. Between each bone lies a **disc** ‚Äî a soft cushion made of:
- **Outer ring (annulus):** Tough, fibrous cover.  
- **Inner core (nucleus):** Gel-like center for shock absorption.  

Think of them like **shock absorbers** in your car. They protect your spine when you bend, lift, or sit.

## Importance of Postural Muscles
Postural muscles (like core, back, and neck stabilizers) act like **support ropes of a tent**.  
- They keep the spine aligned.  
- Reduce stress on discs.  
- Prevent long-term wear and tear.  

Weak postural muscles = more load on discs = higher chance of back/neck pain.

---

## Proper Lifting Technique
‚ùå Wrong way: Bending forward from the waist and pulling weight with your back.  
‚úÖ Right way:  
1. Keep the object close to your body.  
2. Bend your knees (squat), not your waist.  
3. Keep back straight and lift using **leg muscles**, not the spine.  
4. Avoid twisting while lifting.  

---

## Isometric Exercises for Posture
**Isometrics** = Muscle tightening **without movement**.  
Example: pressing palms together.  
**Isotonic** = Muscle tightening **with movement**.  
Example: bicep curls, squats.  

üëâ Isometrics are safer during pain because they **strengthen without straining joints or discs**.
