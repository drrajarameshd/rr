Living well with diabetes is mostly about simple daily habits plus a few regular checks. These steps help prevent complications and keep you feeling your best. Below is a short, practical checklist you can follow — but always personalise with your clinic team’s advice.

## Daily essentials
- **Take medicines as prescribed.** Tablet or insulin timing matters — follow instructions and don’t skip doses. 
- **Monitor blood glucose as advised.** For many people this means spot checks (fasting, pre/post-meals, or when symptomatic). Keep a log to spot patterns.
- **Eat balanced meals and watch portions.** Prefer whole grains, vegetables, lean protein and limit sugary drinks and refined carbs. Small, regular meals often help.
- **Be physically active.** Aim for regular moderate activity most days — even walking 20–30 minutes improves glucose control and heart health.
- **Daily foot check.** Look for cuts, blisters, redness or swelling; promptly clean and report anything worrying. Foot care prevents serious problems.

## Regular checks (talk to your clinic about exact timing)
- **A1C / HbA1c** every 3–6 months (or as advised) to monitor long-term control.
- **Blood pressure & cholesterol** checks — cardiovascular risk is important in diabetes.
- **Annual/regular review** that includes kidney tests (urine microalbumin), eye screening, foot exam and vaccination review.

## Sick-day rules & when to call
- If you have vomiting, high fevers, inability to eat/drink, very high or very low glucose, or signs of infection — contact your doctor or visit emergency care promptly. Keep a simple sick-day plan from your clinic (med changes, fluids, when to test more often).

## Final notes
Small, consistent habits add up. Diabetes self-care is supported by structured education (DSMES/ADCES7) and regular contact with your healthcare team — ask your clinic about education sessions or handouts.
