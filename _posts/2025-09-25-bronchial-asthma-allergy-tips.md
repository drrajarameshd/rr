## 🌬️ What is Bronchial Asthma?
Bronchial Asthma is a **chronic condition where the airways become sensitive and inflamed**, leading to:
- Recurrent **wheezing**  
- **Coughing**, especially at night or early morning  
- **Shortness of breath**  
- **Chest tightness**

It usually gets triggered by **allergens, dust, pollution, weather changes, infections, or strong odors**.

## 🌿 The Allergy Spectrum
Allergic diseases often run together in the same patient or family. They are part of one **allergy spectrum**:
- **Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)** – itchy, dry skin  
- **Urticaria (Hives)** – red, itchy welts on skin  
- **Allergic Rhinitis** – sneezing, runny nose, nasal blockage  
- **Asthma** – wheezing, cough, breathlessness  
- **Other Allergies** – food allergies, drug allergies, insect bites  

A patient may have **one or multiple** conditions at different times.

## ✅ Helpful Tips for Allergic Patients
- Keep your **environment dust-free** (use masks while cleaning, vacuum instead of broom).  
- Avoid strong perfumes, incense sticks, mosquito coils, or smoke.  
- Keep **pets clean** if you are allergic to fur/dander.  
- Prefer **cotton bedding and clothing**; wash them in hot water weekly.  
- Stay updated on **vaccinations** (flu, pneumococcal, COVID).  
- Do **regular exercise**, but avoid triggers like outdoor runs in heavy pollution or pollen season.  
- Keep an **Asthma Action Plan** (with peak flow monitoring if advised by your doctor).

## 💊 OTC Medicines — When Safe?
Some medicines can help mild allergy or asthma symptoms:
- **For Allergic Rhinitis / Urticaria:**  
  - Non-drowsy antihistamines (like *cetirizine, loratadine, fexofenadine*) — safe for short-term relief.  
- **For Asthma:**  
  - Inhalers must be **doctor-prescribed**. Do not self-start steroids or frequent nebulisations without advice.  
  - OTC cough syrups are **not effective** for asthma.  

⚠️ Always confirm with your doctor before regular use.

## 🚨 What To Do in Emergency Situations?

### 1. Acute Asthma Exacerbation
- Sit upright, stay calm, loosen tight clothing.  
- Use your **reliever inhaler (Salbutamol / Albuterol MDI)** — 2 to 4 puffs, repeat every 20 minutes up to 3 times.  
- If symptoms persist or worsen (unable to speak in full sentences, lips turning blue, extreme breathlessness) → **go to ER immediately**.  
- Do **not overuse nebulizers or oral steroids without medical supervision**.  

### 2. Anaphylactic Shock (Severe Allergy Reaction)
Symptoms: sudden **rash, swelling of lips/tongue, difficulty breathing, drop in BP, fainting**.  
- **Immediate action:**  
  - Inject **Adrenaline (Epinephrine) auto-injector** into the outer thigh (if available).  
  - Call emergency services / rush to hospital.  
  - Lie patient flat with legs elevated (unless breathing difficulty worsens).  
  - Do **not wait** for oral medicines to act — only adrenaline saves life.
