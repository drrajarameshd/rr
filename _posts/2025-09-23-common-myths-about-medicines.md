Patients often come across confusing advice and myths regarding medicines and lifestyle habits. These misunderstandings can affect treatment results and long-term health. Here are some **common myths and the truth behind them**.

![Medicine Myths](/assets/images/posts/2025-09-23-common-myths-about-medicines.webp)

## 1. Skipping medicines before testing
Many patients skip tablets or insulin before blood tests “to check if medicines are working.”  
- **Reality:** This is harmful. For example, stopping *Thyronorm* before thyroid profile or diabetes medicines before sugar testing can lead to wrong results.  
- Doctors adjust (up-titrate or down-titrate) doses **based on your reports while on regular treatment**. Skipping medicines will mislead your doctor and harm your health.  

## 2. Using medicines for a short course only
Some medicines (like antibiotics) should be taken **exactly as prescribed**. Stopping early can cause partial treatment and lead to **antibiotic resistance**.  
Other medicines — such as **thyroxine, diabetes drugs, and blood pressure tablets** — are often needed **lifelong**. Always discuss with your doctor before stopping or changing any medication.  

## 3. Importance of simple exercise
Lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and hypertension respond very well to **regular physical activity**.  
- Even **30 minutes of brisk walking, cycling, or yoga** most days of the week improves blood sugar, blood pressure, and heart health.  
- Exercise reduces the need for higher doses of medicines and helps with weight control.  
It is as important as diet and medicines in long-term health.  

## 4. Fear of “getting addicted” to medicines
Patients often worry that they will get “addicted” to tablets.  
- In reality, most medicines stay in the body only for **24 hours** or less. That is why they need to be taken daily.  
- Once your condition improves (e.g., after weight loss and regular exercise), many medicines can be **reduced or even stopped safely under medical supervision**.  
Medicines are tools — not addictions.  

## 5. Phobia about insulin
Insulin is often feared as a “last stage” treatment.  
- The truth: Insulin is simply a **replacement therapy**, just like thyroxine for hypothyroidism.  
- In advanced diabetes, the pancreas cannot make enough insulin. Continuing to push it with tablets is not useful. Timely initiation of insulin prevents complications.  
- If an oral insulin tablet is developed in the future, it will replace injections — but until then, **don’t delay insulin when it is needed**.  

## 6. Herbal medicines in jaundice
A common belief is that “natural” or “herbal” remedies are always safe.  
- **Reality:** In jaundice, the liver is already compromised. Herbal medicines or any toxins are primarily metabolised by the liver, which makes the situation worse.  
- Some herbs can directly damage liver cells and worsen jaundice.  
- Remember: *Everything green is not healthy.* There are poisonous plants in nature that can kill humans.  
It is far safer to **avoid unproven herbal medicines** and follow your doctor’s advice for jaundice management.

- Don’t fear insulin — it is a lifesaving therapy when needed.  
- Don’t believe that all “natural” products are safe.  
- Don’t self-medicate with herbal remedies during jaundice or liver disease.
