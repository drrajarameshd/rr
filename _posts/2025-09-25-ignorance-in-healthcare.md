We often hear about **patients losing valuable time, health, and money** because of ignorance or misplaced trust. With clever marketing, even dangerous products or unscientific services can look appealing. Unfortunately, people get trapped — like an *innocent prey walking into the jaws of a lion*.

## A Famous Lesson — Steve Jobs  
Even the founder of Apple, **Steve Jobs**, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer but chose alternative treatments initially. By the time he turned to proven medical therapy, it was too late. This shows how even the brightest minds can be misguided when fear and hope collide.

## Story 1: Delayed Treatment in Diabetes — A Costly Error  
One of my patients, a diabetic, underwent angiogram and was advised **CABG (bypass surgery)**.  
- Instead of proceeding, he was misled by a so-called “doctor” who offered **daily injections claiming to dissolve clots**.  
- Months later, he returned with **heart failure, swollen legs (pedal edema), and kidney damage (raised creatinine)**.  
- In search of hope, he lost crucial time.  

👉 **Lesson:** Delayed treatment in diabetes can lead to **diabetic nephropathy, kidney failure, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)**. Timely, evidence-based medical care saves lives.

## Story 2: Allergic Contact Dermatitis — The Fake Solution  
Another patient from *Misho* brought a “miracle solution” advertised to close ear piercing holes.  
- After applying, her **earlobe developed severe inflammation**, and the skin split into two halves.  
- The reaction turned into a painful **allergic contact dermatitis** with infection.  

👉 **Lesson:** Cosmetic or household “quick-fix” solutions are unsafe. Allergic contact dermatitis happens when chemicals directly irritate or sensitize the skin. Always seek **dermatology or physician guidance** for safe treatment.

## Story 3: Steroid Misuse in Joint Pain — The Hidden Trap  
One day, a young obese woman walked into my clinic with **multiple joint pains and stiffness**.  
- She had been on **steroids for 3 months** — originally prescribed for short-term relief.  
- Each time she stopped, the pain worsened, so she continued steroids on her own.  
- The result: **rapid weight gain, stretch marks on her stomach, weakness**, and classic signs of **Cushing’s syndrome**.  

This is a common trap:  
- **Osteoarthritis patients** misuse painkillers and damage kidneys.  
- **Rheumatoid arthritis patients** misuse steroids and end up with Cushing’s.  

👉 **Lesson:** Some drugs are **life-saving when used correctly** but **dangerous if continued without supervision**. Steroids are meant for short courses. For rheumatoid arthritis, the right choice is **DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs)** — they act slowly but work long-term. Quick fixes are tempting, but they come with a heavy price.

## The Bigger Picture  
- Fake products and unqualified practitioners **sell false hope**.  
- Patients suffer not only **physical harm**, but also **mental trauma and financial loss**.  
- With attractive marketing, people may believe anything — until reality strikes.  

Being aware and cautious is the only way to avoid these traps.
