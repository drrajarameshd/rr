Attapur and surrounding colonies near the **Musi river** — like Rajendranagar, Aramghar, PVNR Expressway belt, Hyderguda, and Mehdipatnam outskirts — face a common challenge every monsoon. Stagnant water pockets left after rains become ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes.  

These mosquitoes are not just a nuisance — they carry **dengue and chikungunya viruses**, which cause fever, severe joint pain, and sometimes life-threatening complications.

## How mosquitoes spread diseases
- **Stagnant water** in broken pots, coolers, roadside drains, and open plots allows *Aedes aegypti* mosquitoes to multiply.  
- These mosquitoes bite during **daytime**, making protection even harder.  
- Once infected, they spread viruses rapidly across entire neighborhoods.

## A story from my clinic
Every monsoon, patients walk into my Attapur clinic with **high fever and severe joint pains**.  

One such patient, a middle-aged lady, had already consulted multiple doctors and tried painkillers with little relief. She had **post-viral arthritis** after chikungunya — pain so intense she struggled to walk or use her hands.  

On careful examination, I explained that chikungunya often leaves behind **lingering arthritis** for weeks or months. With a **short, mild course of steroids**, she improved significantly and was able to return to normal activities.  

This story repeats every season. Chikungunya may be painful, but it is still considered *manageable* compared to dengue.

## Dengue — the dangerous cousin
While chikungunya causes long-lasting joint pain, **dengue can be deadly**.  

- Dengue virus can lead to **severe thrombocytopenia** (low platelets).  
- In some cases, it progresses to **Dengue Shock Syndrome**, which can be fatal.  
- Early warning signs include:  
  - High fever  
  - Severe headache  
  - Red skin rash (measles-like)  
  - Bleeding gums or nose  
  - Sudden drop in platelet count  

**Early identification and hospital care save lives.** Platelet monitoring and timely transfusion can prevent complications.

## Do’s & Don’ts during monsoon

✅ **Do’s**  
- Keep your surroundings free of stagnant water.  
- Use mosquito repellents, nets, and wear full-sleeved clothing.  
- Check platelet counts early if fever persists beyond 2–3 days.  
- Seek medical care promptly for rash, bleeding, or severe weakness.  

❌ **Don’ts**  
- Don’t ignore persistent fever and joint pains.  
- Don’t self-medicate with painkillers (some can worsen bleeding in dengue).  
- Don’t delay medical help — dengue can worsen rapidly.

## Final thoughts
Monsoon in Musi belt areas like Attapur brings beauty but also danger. **Mosquito control and early medical attention** are the only ways to prevent suffering.  

While **chikungunya leaves behind arthritis**, **dengue can take lives**. Recognising symptoms early, staying alert, and consulting your doctor can make all the difference.
