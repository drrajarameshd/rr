## 📌 What are GI & GL?

- **Glycemic Index (GI):** Measures how fast a food raises blood sugar (scale 0–100).  
  - **Low GI (≤55):** Slow rise (good).  
  - **Medium GI (56–69):** Moderate effect.  
  - **High GI (≥70):** Quick spike (bad).  

- **Glycemic Load (GL):** Considers both GI *and* portion size.  
  - **Low GL (≤10):** Safe.  
  - **Medium GL (11–19):** Caution.  
  - **High GL (≥20):** Avoid excess.  

👉 In short: **GI = speed**, **GL = impact**.

---

## 🍛 Biryani  
- **Rice GI:** White basmati ~70 (high).  
- **GL:** High due to large portions.  
- **Oil & ghee** add calories and worsen insulin resistance.  
✅ **Better:** Use brown rice biryani (GI ~50), smaller portions, more salan + raita.  

---

## 🫓 Naan & Rotis  
- **Naan, rumali roti:** Made of maida → GI 70–80, high GL.  
- **Whole wheat roti/phulka:** GI ~60, medium.  
✅ **Choose whole wheat over maida.**  

---

## 🍗 Fried & High-Oil Foods  
- **Chicken 65, deep-fried kebabs, pakodas, samosas:** Oil + flour coating → high calories, worsen insulin resistance.  
✅ **Prefer grilled or plain tandoori chicken without maida coating.**  

---

## 🌯 Shawarmas, Pizzas & Burgers  
- **Shawarma roll:** Maida roti + mayo → High GI + fat.  
- **Pizza:** Refined flour base (GI ~75), cheese + processed meats → heavy.  
- **Burger:** White bread bun (GI ~70) + fried patty.  
⚠️ Not diabetic-friendly for regular intake.  

---

## 🍮 Double ka Meetha & Sweets  
- **Double ka Meetha:** Bread + sugar syrup + ghee + dry fruits → Very high GI & GL.  
- **Indian sweets (gulab jamun, jalebi, laddu):** Extremely high sugar load.  
- **Cool drinks:** GI ~65–75, almost pure glucose → immediate sugar spike.  
🚫 Best to avoid or keep for rare occasions only.  

---

## 🍑 Khubani ka Meetha, Dates & Raisins  
- **Apricots (khubani):** GI ~34, GL ~8 (low if eaten raw). But in dessert form with sugar/cream → high GL.  
- **Dates (khajoor):** GI 42–55 (low–medium). 2–3 dates are okay; more raises sugar.  
- **Raisins (kishmish):** GI ~64 (medium). Safe only in very small amounts.  
✅ Fresh apricots, limited dates, and small raisins are okay.  

---

## ✅ Takeaway for Hyderabadis with Diabetes
1. Pick **low GI foods** (brown rice, whole wheat roti, dals, veggies).  
2. Watch **portion size** (GL matters more than GI alone).  
3. **Limit sweets, fried snacks, cool drinks** — keep for rare treats.  
4. Choose **grilled over fried meats**.  
5. Hydrate with **water, buttermilk, lemon water** instead of sodas.
