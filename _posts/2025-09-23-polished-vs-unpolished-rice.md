## Understanding the structure of rice grain

When rice is harvested, each grain has multiple layers:  
- **Husk** – The hard outer shell. Inedible and removed during husking.  
- **Bran** – The thin brownish or reddish layer rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.  
- **Endosperm** – The inner white starchy part. This is the main edible portion in polished rice.

## Processing of rice

1. **Husking** – The husk (outer shell) is removed. Result = *brown rice* (bran intact).  
2. **Polishing** – Further rubbing removes the bran layer. Result = *polished white rice*.  

👉 **Brown rice** = husk removed, bran layer intact.  
👉 **Red rice** = bran intact, but naturally red due to plant pigments.  
👉 **Polished rice** = bran removed, only white starchy endosperm left.

## Who should be cautious with brown/red rice?

Brown and red rice are very healthy, but not suitable for everyone:  
- **People with weak digestion** – may feel bloated.  
- **Patients with advanced kidney disease** – must restrict potassium & phosphorus.

- Brown and red rice are **nutrient-rich and healthier** for diabetes, heart health, and weight control.  
- Even mixing **50% brown/red rice with white rice** can give better health benefits while keeping the taste acceptable.
