## 🌾 Rice grain structure

Each grain has 3 main layers:  
- **🌰 Husk** – Hard outer shell, removed during husking.  
- **🥜 Bran** – Thin brown/red layer, rich in fiber and nutrients.  
- **🍚 Endosperm** – White starchy inside (main edible part in polished rice).

## ⚙️ Processing of rice

1. **Husking** – Removes husk → *brown rice* (bran intact).  
2. **Polishing** – Removes bran → *white rice*.  

👉 **Brown rice** = husk removed, bran kept.  
👉 **Red rice** = bran intact, but naturally red.  
👉 **Polished rice** = bran removed, only starchy part remains.
