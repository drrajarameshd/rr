## 1. Core principles
- **Regular meal timings:** Avoid long gaps and erratic eating; aim for 3 main meals + 1â€“2 healthy snacks if needed.  
- **Balanced plate approach:**  
  - Â½ vegetables (salads, cooked curries, greens)  
  - Â¼ whole grains (unpolished rice, millets, whole wheat)  
  - Â¼ protein (dal, pulses, sprouts, fish, egg, lean chicken)  
- **Control portion size:** Even healthy foods raise sugars if taken in excess. Use smaller plates if helpful.  

## 2. South Indian staples â€” what to choose
- **Rice:** Prefer brown rice, hand-pounded rice, red rice, or millets (ragi, foxtail, little millet) instead of polished white rice. Keep quantity moderate.  
- **Idli/Dosa:** Use a mix of rice + dals + millets. Choose smaller portions, pair with sambar (dal + vegetables) and chutney (without excess coconut or oil).  
- **Upma/Pongal:** Prepare with broken wheat, rava, or millets; add vegetables and limit ghee.  
- **Chapati/Phulka:** Good option with dals/vegetables. Limit parathas with excess oil.  
- **Curries & sides:** Include plenty of green leafy vegetables (keerai), gourds, beans, cabbage, drumstick, brinjal.  
- **Snacks:** Sundal (steamed pulses), sprouts, buttermilk, fruit (in moderation). Avoid fried snacks (bajji, vada, chips).  

## 3. Foods to limit
- **Refined carbs:** White bread, bakery items, sweets, polished rice in large portions.  
- **Sugary drinks:** Soft drinks, packaged juices, sweetened tea/coffee.  
- **Deep-fried snacks:** Mixtures, pakoras, vadas, chips.  
- **High-fat gravies:** With excess coconut, cashew, cream, or oil.  

## 4. Protein & healthy fats
- **Protein:** Dals, pulses, sprouts, low-fat milk/curd, paneer, egg whites, fish, chicken (grilled/boiled).  
- **Fats:** Use small amounts of groundnut oil, sunflower, rice bran, or sesame oil. Limit vanaspati and reused oils.  
- **Nuts:** Almonds, walnuts, groundnuts in moderation â€” avoid salted/fried versions.  

## 5. Fruits in diabetes
- Prefer seasonal, whole fruits (apple, orange, papaya, guava, watermelon).  
- Limit high-sugar fruits (mango, sapota, banana, grapes).  
- **Rule of thumb:** 1 medium fruit or Â½ cup cut fruit at a time. Never as juice.  

## 6. Practical tips
- Eat slowly, chew well â€” helps portion control.  
- Donâ€™t skip breakfast; skipping meals causes sugar fluctuations.  
- Carry healthy snacks (nuts, sprouts, buttermilk) instead of biscuits or fried foods.  
- Drink adequate water, limit coffee/tea with sugar.  
- Prefer home-cooked food over restaurant meals.  

## Final notes
South Indian diets can be very healthy for people with diabetes when simple adjustments are made: **whole grains, more vegetables, moderate rice, and limited fried/sugary foods.**  
Always personalise diet plans with your healthcare provider or dietitian â€” especially if you are on insulin or multiple medicines.
