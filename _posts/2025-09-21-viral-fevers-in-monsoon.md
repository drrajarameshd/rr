Monsoon season in India brings a rise in viral infections. Most fevers are viral and self-limiting, but some require careful monitoring. Here are answers to frequently asked questions:

## 1. Antibiotics & viral fevers
- **Antibiotics do not cure viral infections.** They only work for bacterial infections.  
- Unnecessary use leads to resistance and side effects.  
- Use antibiotics only if your doctor confirms a bacterial infection.

## 2. Antivirals — when are they useful?
- Most viral fevers do not need antivirals.  
- **Influenza (flu):** Elderly and patients with diabetes, heart, lung, or kidney disease may benefit from early antiviral treatment.  
- **Severe influenza viral pneumonia** (similar to COVID-19) can cause **low oxygen levels (hypoxia)** — sometimes requiring oxygen support or hospital admission.  

## 3. Dengue, chikungunya & other arboviruses
- **Platelet monitoring is important** in dengue.  
- **Myth:** Papaya leaf juice does not dramatically increase platelets.  
- **Fact:** If platelets drop very low with bleeding risk, transfusion helps. Ultimately, platelets are made in the bone marrow — no quick fix.  
- **Chikungunya** often causes severe joint pains.  
- **Other viral fevers** may mimic dengue; testing helps confirm.

## 4. Other monsoon viral infections in India
- **Enteroviruses & gastroenteritis** — cause diarrhoea, dehydration.  
- **Hepatitis A & E** — spread through contaminated food and water.  
- **Respiratory viruses** — flu, RSV, adenovirus often rise in crowded, humid conditions.  

## 5. Precautions during monsoon
- **Mosquito control:** Use nets, repellents, remove stagnant water.  
- **Hand hygiene:** Wash hands regularly with soap, especially before eating.  
- **Food & water safety:** Drink clean water, avoid roadside food in unhygienic places.  
- **Crowd precautions:** Stay home if sick, maintain distance in crowded areas.  
- **Masking if unwell** helps reduce spread of respiratory viruses.  

## Final notes
Most viral fevers recover with rest, fluids, and supportive care. See your doctor promptly if you have:
- Persistent high fever  
- Breathing difficulty or oxygen drop  
- Severe abdominal pain, bleeding, or confusion  
- Very low platelets or worsening symptoms  

Stay alert in monsoon — simple precautions protect you and your family.
